Part 1 Facilitated Feature: Creating a form for adding new stories. 

Features to implement: 
---● Order the stories by date. 
● Style the form for adding new stories.

● Account view so authors can see their profile information. 
● Create Account functionality, so a new user can sign up to be an author. 
● View stories by a particular author. 
● Show/Hide the relevant information and buttons based on whether the user is logged in/out (e.g. should only be able to see the button to create a new story if I am logged in). 
● Enable/Disable the relevant features based on whether the user is logged in/out (e.g. should only be able to create a new story if I am logged in). 

Additional Features 
● Add categories to the stories and allow the user to search for stories by category. 
● Add the ability to update and delete stories.
● Add the ability to “favourite” stories and see a page with your favourite stories. 

Note 
● You will use Django to create the website, and no other additional libraries are allowed unless approved by the Lead Mentor. 
● Make it your own! The codestarter provided is to help you get the structure set up, and so you can look at something a little less ugly than the default ;) By the time you submit this, I would hope that you would have customised it to your taste and to what you think the She Codes News website should look like :) See the appendix for some inspiration. 

Submission
Your code will be submitted via GitHub. 
Please include a directory in your repository containing a screenshot(s) of every page on your website.
